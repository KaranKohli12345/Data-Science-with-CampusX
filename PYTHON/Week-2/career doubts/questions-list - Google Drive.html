I am already a working professional with 3.5 years of experience at Bosch. I wish to make a switch and data science. I even got a call from many companies in past. But those were small companies so I did not join.Most of, the companies ask for corporate experience so even if we make good projects, we fail in terms of corporate experience. Example last December I got a call from SAP and they were okay with the projects I made but when they asked about corporate experience I failed due to which they refused to go ahead with my application (just to remember: they were satisfied with my project and were okay for 350+ % hike but once they got to know about my experience years they refused). How to deal with this? How to fake experience. Because if we only make projects and tell him that I have done this in my company, they will easily find out when they start asking questions related to it. Like how I handle the situation and who all were there in my team, what part I was handling in my team etc etc.</div></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="0R61" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">62</div></th><td class="s0">Hii sir..
